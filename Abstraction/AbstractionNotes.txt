*Abstraction*
 Ans> Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

*Ways to achieve Abstraction*
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
(1)Abstract class (0 to 100%)
(2)Interface (100%)

*Abstract class in Java*
Ans>A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. 
    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
*Points to Remember*
>An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
>It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
>It cannot be instantiated.
>It can have constructors and static methods also.
>It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

*Example of abstract class

abstract class A
{

}  

*Abstract Method in Java*
Ans>A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

Example of abstract method

abstract void printStatus();//no method body and abstract
